# Markora

Markora is a self-hostable, multi-user Markdown knowledge workspace. This repository is implementing
the frozen V1 specification in [`markora-spec`](./markora-spec/README.md).

## Current status

Phase 5 search vertical slice: PostgreSQL hybrid English/CJK search, transactional indexes,
workspace/folder/subtree scope isolation, progressive Search, Quick Open and route-valid Command
Palette keyboard flows. Earlier identity, content, editor, versions and Trash guarantees remain
enforced across every route.
